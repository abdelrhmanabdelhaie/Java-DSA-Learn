//Problem #6: Two stacks
//        ● Change our class to be able to perform the stack operations but simulating 2
//        stacks in same time. Consider the following constraints
//          ○ Use only the same single array
//          ○ All operations should have the same old time/memory complexity
//          ○ Each stack can use as much as possible of available array
//           ■ For example, assume we created stack of 100 elements
//              ● The first stack used 20 elements so far
//              ● Then the second stack can use up to 80 elements and so on
//        ● Change functions similar to following: void push(int id, int x)
//          ○ Id either 1 or 2 to refer to the stack itself

//        ● We create a stack of 10 elements
//        ● Then we can perform operations, given the id
